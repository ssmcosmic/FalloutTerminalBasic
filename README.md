I found the Fallout game series to be super fun after initially dropping it and restarting years later. In every game, there was always this aspect of terminal hacking that I quite enjoyed, and I wondered whether I could implement a basic version of the terminal. Similar to how I had dropped Fallout 4 the first time I played it, I had also dropped this project, until now.

This project is a work-in-progress, and for now, aims to implement the most basic version of the terminal. I aim to improve and add more features in later versions.

1) Store the main.py file and the wordbank.txt in the same folder
2) Change the folder directory inside main.py to the folder in step 1
3) Ensure the versions match those below (the program might still work but is not guaranteed)
4) The program should now run
